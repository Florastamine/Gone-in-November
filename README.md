# Gone In November

Welcome to Gone In November's official development page!

As the game has gone commercial (it will be released sometimes in May 2016 on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) and other digital distribution platforms), I'll defer updating the repository at least three months after the release. 

You can view the original ```README.md``` before the update [here](https://github.com/Florastamine/Gone-in-November/blob/master/README_old.md).
