# Gone In November

Welcome to Gone In November's official development page!

Gone In November is a first-person exploration, surreal interactive story about rain, solitude, being forgotten and loss. It is currently in active development by one person and it is written with the help of the Acknex rendering/game library.

As the game code is updated directly on this GitHub page, you can easily tell if the game is still being developed just by looking at the last commit date. If it was made more than a month ago, then something must be wrong!

If you wish to collaborate, let me know. I'll be very happy! (as the game is progressing fairly slow). Leave me a message at:
* My personal Gmail account (florastamine@gmail.com)
* My Vn-Sharing.net account (http://vn-sharing.net/forum/member.php?u=15466)

Currently I am accepting only 2D artists.

More information (early releases, progress, news) can be found on the game's main web page: [Here!](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26857618/DP/index.html)
