# Gone In November

Welcome to Gone In November's official development page!

Gone In November is a first-person exploration, surreal interactive story about rain, solitude, being forgotten and loss. It is currently in active development by one person and it is written with the help of the Acknex rendering/game library.

## Description
This directory is reserved for test code. These code were written for testing various limitations/aspects of the Acknex game engine, and usually contain a complete workaround.

## Running the tests
You'll file a batch script named ```run_sample.bat``` in the **utils** folder. Run it, and choose the test you want to run from the **tests** folder.

### Remarks
When conducting a test, do not name the file the same as the header/source code you are going to include. This will confuse the compiler and in most cases you'll get a beautiful crash.
