# Gone In November

Welcome to Gone In November's official development page!

Gone In November is a first-person exploration, surreal interactive story about rain, solitude, being forgotten and loss. It is currently in active development by one person and it is written with the help of the Acknex rendering/game library.

## Description
This directory is reserved for 2D assets needed by shaders (for example, toon lookup table image required by the toon shader, or the bump-mapped wave textures for the ocean shader).
