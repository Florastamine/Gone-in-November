# Gone In November

Welcome to Gone In November's official development page!

Gone In November is a first-person exploration, surreal interactive story about rain, solitude, being forgotten and loss. It is currently in active development by one person and it is written with the help of the Acknex rendering/game library.

## Description
Save games produced by Gamestudio's built-in API like **game_save()** end in **.sav**, while the ones produced by our own serializer will have the ***.nov*** extension.
