# Gone In November

Welcome to Gone In November's official development page!

Gone In November is a first-person exploration, surreal interactive story about rain, solitude, being forgotten and loss. It is currently in active development by one person and it is written with the help of the Acknex rendering/game library.

## Description
This directory is reserved for a number of AutoIT-based tools I wrote during the development of GiN. Note that these scripts only aid in the development process, and thus does not have anything to do with the main code base.
Each script has its description and usage instructions.
