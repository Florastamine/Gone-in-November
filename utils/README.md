# Gone In November

Welcome to Gone In November's official development page!

Gone In November is a first-person exploration, surreal interactive story about rain, solitude, being forgotten and loss. It is currently in active development by one person and it is written with the help of the Acknex rendering/game library.

## Description
This directory contains various helper utilities which aid in the development process. For example, the build script automagically does everything from building the assets binding list to resolving dependencies and the build process, which simplifies life a lot.
