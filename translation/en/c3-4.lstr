                        Now you are even heavier than before.
It's a burden carrying you on my back all the way to school and elsewhere. 

                             Are you mocking my weight?

                                            Nope.
    Just want to say that I'm not currently eligible for insurance yet.

          But I don't want to sit in a wheelchair. It's so frustrating.
