                        You are even heavier than before.
It's starting to take a toll on me carrying you on my back all the way to school and back.

                           Are you mocking my weight?

		Err, no. Even I wish I could be chubby sometimes. It's kinda cute.
					  Do you dislike wheelchairs that much? 
									...
					It's so frustrating sitting in wheelchairs.
		And it's comforting too, knowing you're always be there for me.
								I love you.
