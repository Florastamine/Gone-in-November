Hey you silly!
Come over here and help me standing up.

What? Mom doesn't allow me to get close to strangers.

But you are the only one walking around this park.
And I have physical defects.

Isn't these people all have their angel wings already?

Geez, just help me already.
You boys are always so annoying every time.
