Hey you!
Come over here and help me standing up.

But mom said I shouldn't get close to strangers.

But you are the only one walking around this park.
And I have leg malformation.

But that was exactly the reason crutches were invented.

But... geez, just help me already.
You boys are always so annoying every time.
