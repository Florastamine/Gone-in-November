Hey you silly!
Come over here and help me standing up.

What? Mom said I shouldn't get close to strangers.

But you are the only one walking around this park.
And I have physical defects.

Isn't these people all have their angel wings already?

Geez, just help me already.
You boys are always so annoying every time.
