There is always a choice.

I got a message from an old friend who offered for help with the treatment expense.
After all, I have to move on. It's a part of life.
You won't be coming back.
But
At least
We used to be together.
I used to be yours.
It is more important than anything else.

Everything is going to be alright.

I wish
I wish heaven had a phone so I can hear your voice once more time again.
