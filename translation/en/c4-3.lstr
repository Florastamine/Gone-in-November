Since you're my best buddy, let me put this into plain words.

                      Pull the plug. It's killing you.
                           You know what it is.

                                  Just do it.
    Don't burn your precious youth and your time on her.
                You are supposed to enjoy your life.

              Keep ignoring me and moving forward.
                              You will regret.
