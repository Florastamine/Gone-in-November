Since you're my best friend, let me put this into plain words.

                      Stop whatever you're doing.
                           You know what it is.

                                  Just. stop.
    Don't burn your youth and your precious time on her.
                You are supposed to enjoy your life.

              Keep ignoring me and moving forward.
                              You will regret.
