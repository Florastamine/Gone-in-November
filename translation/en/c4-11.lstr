Maybe it'd be better for her to be with someone else

I've been keeping her in isolation for so long that I could not realize that I was being more and more selfish.

I've been slowing her down for so long that I have completely lost myself.

All these scars.
All these tears.

Four years.
Passed in the blink of an eye.

Everything's collapsing in front of both of us.
