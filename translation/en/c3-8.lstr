You booked the ticket already?

I.. I have an overtime session on Friday.
And we're going to have a meeting on Saturday.
Also I have to work during the extra holiday to meet the deadline.

Sorry...

Don't worry. We can always make another arrangement.
Perhaps next week?

I'm sure I'll be free by then.
