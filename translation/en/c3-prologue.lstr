Everybody has their own comfort zone which can only be experienced by sleeping.

I, too, have my own comfort zone. 

Every day I wake up, open my eyes, then all of a sudden, the reality nightmare kicks in and abruptly slaps me in the face. 
I have no other choice but to deal with it.

It is horrible.

That's why I have the tendency of overdosing on pills, like, nearly every day. 

It's strange that I haven't died. Yet.
