Everybody has their own comfort zone which can only be experienced through sleeping.

I, too, have my own comfort zone. 

Every day I wake up, open my eyes when all of a sudden, the reality kicks in and slaps me in the face. 
I have no other choice but to deal with it.
...
Or I can just simply keep myself to the comfort, dying a slow death.

That's why I have the tendency of overdosing on pills, nearly every day. 

It's strange that I haven't died. Yet.
