Another day.
Another step closer to nihilism.

We plan to meet at the local bus station near my place.

[21:47]
She didn't come.
She promised, but she didn't come.

[22:12]
I tried calling her several times.
But no one answered the phone.

[22:24]
Worried, I put on the scarf and rushed to the bus stop.
But no one was there.
