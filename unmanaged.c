 * <unmanaged>
 * Place for kind of "unmanaged code". No, there's no C# scent here - 
 * what I am referring to for "unmanaged code" is the code that were 
 * generated from 3rd-party tools, like particle code, that is expected 
 * to be usable right away without additional tinkering. That is - they
 * are generated and used right away without being modified in any way - 
 * whatever that would be (coding styles, algorithms, ...)
