This is my first time blogging with Jekyll after wasted almost a day struggling, making it work, thanks to my zero knowledge about GitHub pages and web programming in general. Still, it was a worthy move, as the old, home-brew, HTML4-based web page which I made is freaking ugly and way too inefficient to maintain.

Official development of GiN was started during the end of October 2015 (first commit were made on October 21). Since then, I've had over 200 commits pushed to the official repository. This is, indeed, fairly slow for a 4-month old project, but given that at that time I only had the very basic idea, and I had to do all the designing document stuff, website design/coding, blogging, game logic planning and coding, art drawing, story writing and all these super complicated narration stuff, plus holiday took another 20% of my time and I only spend 3 - 4 hours per day on the project.

A very early pre-alpha version of the game will soon be released, but it is for testing the stability of the game, not for showing game features or anything. At this point, I have not actually written any game-specific code, as the story hasn't been completely laid out, and the core code is still not done yet. After the alpha, further development will be temporary halted until the story is fully solid. By the way, I will not provide the alpha version under source code form as you'll need the game assets in order to be able to compile the game, instead you'll get a zip file containing Win32 binaries and a packed resource file which you can run right away.

This year's gonna be awesome.

Oh, and I forget. Happy (Lunar) New Year! Whoever is reading this, I sincerely wish you the best!
