# Gone In November

Welcome to Gone In November's official development page!

Gone In November is a first-person exploration, surreal interactive story about rain, solitude, being forgotten and loss. It is currently in active development by one person and it is written with the help of the Acknex rendering/game library.

## Description
This directory is reserved for both compiled and uncompiled game scenes. As Acknex uses BSP for visibility calculations, scenes have to be compiled (and thus the BSP tree is calculated) before it can be used. Additionally an uncompiled scene (**.wmp**) can have an extra path list (**.wdl**) which includes the necessary paths when the scene is looking for assets.

Compiled levels have the **.wmb** extension.
