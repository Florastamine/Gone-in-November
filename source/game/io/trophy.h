 * <trophy>
 * A very, very simple achievements interface. At first this achievement "system" was present as the part of the overall
 * GiN design, but later got deprecated (only the header is preserved for historical reasons) because of the following reasons:
 * 1/ This is just a small game and thus doesn't need it. Plus, the game is not action or gameplay-oriented, it's more like of a exploration game coupled with some mysterious and
 * horror atmosphere. Not taking the risk of distracting players with useless achievements.
 * 2/ If the game got later Steamworks integration, the old system has to be removed in replacement of Steamworks' own system. No need to double the work.
 * 3/ As of time of the creation of this header (01.25.16), Godot is coming more and more closer to 2.0. Therefore I want
 * to finish and release this game as fast as possible, to move to a larger/better/modern engine.
 *
 * The actual problem is not "CAN" I implement it, but does it worth?
